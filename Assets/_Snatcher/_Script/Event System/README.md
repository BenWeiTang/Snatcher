# Event System

The event system in Snatcher is based on ScriptableObject, and references the implementation by [Dapper Dino](https://www.youtube.com/c/DapperDinoCodingTutorials) from his YouTube tutorial series. (See [Part 1](https://youtu.be/iXNwWpG7EhM) and [Part 2](https://youtu.be/P-U7GPXMtLY)). The system allows for flexibility in defining the types of callback for an event.

The system consists of [Events](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/blob/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System/Event/AGameEvent.cs), [Listeners](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/blob/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System/Listener/AGameEventListener.cs), and [Unity Events](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System/Unity%20Event). Events are implementations of ScriptableObjects, which also support [C#-style events](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/blob/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System/Event/AGameEvent.cs#L9). Listeners are MonoBehaviour attached to GameObjects. Unity Events are class overrides, specificed in the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent_1.html) for extending callback types.
