Snatcher is a 2.5D roguelite game where you play as Snatcher, a frog-like, tiny creature who can steal enemies abilities for its own use to traverse through the environment. Highlight features include [Hierarchical FSM](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Player%20State%20Machine) for the player controller, [ScriptableObjects-based FSM](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Enemy%20State%20Machine) for the enemy AI, and [ScriptableOject-based Event System](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System) for generic usage.
